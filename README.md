# NewsApp

The objective is to develop a mobile application that retrieves the most recent news feed from the newsapi.org API. Upon login, users can view news based on their preferred categories and location. The application is being built using the Flutter framework, which manages the View and Control aspects, adhering to the MVC architecture. User information is kept on Firebase.
